# Reaction Time Game

This is a simple game that measures how fast your reactions and reflexes are.

## Game idea

-   The game starts when the player clicks the Start Game button.
-   After that the game shows a green box to the player after a random amount of time.
-   The player has to click on the box as fast as possible in order for him to achieve a high score

## Technologies Used

I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. <br>
**[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** for asset bundling. <br>
**[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)**
3 [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup.html#composition-api-setup) for the game logic and UI reactivity.

## Game Logic

## Project setup

1. Installing frontend assets

```bash
npm install

2. Running the app

3. Open the game in the browser from **[Here](https://ahmedosman101.github.io/ReactionTimeGame/)**
